# Assume sales_data is a NumPy array containing quarterly sales data
# Example data for demonstration purposes
sales_data = np.array([10000, 12000, 15000, 18000])

# Calculate the total sales for the year

# Determine the percentage increase in sales from the first quarter to the fourth quarter
# Formula: ((sales in fourth quarter - sales in first quarter) / sales in first quarter) * 100
percentage_increase = ((sales_data[3] - sales_data[0]) / sales_data[0]) * 100

print("Total sales for the year:", total_sales_for_year)

#output:
Total sales for the year: 55000
Percentage increase in sales from the first quarter to the fourth quarter: 80.0 %
